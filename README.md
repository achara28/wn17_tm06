# ClassQA - A web based mobile platform for real-time multiple choice questions during a lecture

ClassQA is a web mobile platform that allows students and lecturers to create and sign in lectures. During the lecture time, the lecturer can post questions which appear on the mobile phone of students and the student can answer using their smartphones. The platform presents the correct answer as well as statistics about how the students answered the question.
